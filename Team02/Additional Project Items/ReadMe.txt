Advanced requirement #1: Multiplayer and voice chat. Used to communicate with each other in game and see each other's locations. Selected because it works well with our theme of a game/hangout space. 

Advanced requirement #2: Document sharing/presenting. Used to share files across players and works well with multiplayer. 

Interaction techniques: turn on/off lights, turn on/off tv and jukebox, pick up items, throw items, place them on board games. Used with typical button presses on a controller in combination with raycast of player. 

Multiplayer instructions: ensure each vr device is connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Open the game, and you should be connected easily with everyone!
