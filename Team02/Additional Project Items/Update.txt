 ● (Low) The environment was quite well set, so I can see the final result would be nice. 

 ● (Medium) Rotation-locking objects that users have picked up to place may help users make better object rearrangements. -completed ✅, involved manually rotating object in a script every time it was picked up

 ● (Low) Being able to see my box avatar is a little off-putting and it having a collider may be unnecessary. -completed ✅, changed to a better avatar with custom selection menu

 ● (High) The raycast should be placed on camera. -completed ✅, required reorganizing hierarchy and redesigning scripts

 ● (High) Dropping the object at a certain location is not available. -completed when sitting down ✅, added joystick controls to adjust position relative to camera

 ● (Medium) The number of interactions were too low (TV, travel). -completed ✅, added light interaction, jukebox, and lots of game objects

 ● (High) Could not sometimes sit on the couch. * -✅ must be very close to couch

 ● (High) The raycast is a bit weird for teleporting. ✅ fixed, made it a lot more accurate by repositioning and rewriting scripts

 ● (Medium) Tried to turn on lamp by shade, but only base worked. * ✅fixed, enabled interaction in all parts of lamp

 ● (Medium) Raycast disappears sometimes – likely due to collision with couch or player. ✅fixed, rewrote and made adjustments like mentioned above

 ● (High) Grab is choppy and object is too far from player. ✅fixed, rewrote script

 ● (Low) Would like to throw and break objects for fun. ✅added throwing, involved writing other method within grab script to give object velocity
